# Model1 Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating the core Model1 class functionality for TRS-80 Model I hardware interface.

## Overview

The Model1 class provides the primary interface for controlling the TRS-80 Model I hardware via the 40-pin edge connector. It handles bus control, memory operations, I/O operations, and system diagnostics.

## TRS-80 Model I Hardware Interface

The Arduino interfaces with the TRS-80 through:

- **Address Bus** (16-bit): Memory and I/O addressing
- **Data Bus** (8-bit): Data transfer
- **Control Signals**: Read/Write enable, Memory/IO select
- **Clock Signals**: System timing and synchronization
